		<p>Add-ons Builder is a website for quickly and easily building Firefox add-ons
		using common web technologies. If you aren't familiar with the site, <a
		href="/tutorial/">start by reading the tutorial</a>, which gives you
		step-by-step guide to building an add-on.</p>

		<p>The add-ons you build can make changes to the browser via libraries of modules
		that provide APIs for accessing Firefox functionality. The core library is
		available by default to all add-ons and provides the most commonly-requested
		APIs, including APIs for accessing tabs, storing data, displaying a widget, and
		making network requests. Add-ons can also use libraries contributed by other
		users of the site.</p>

		<p>For documentation of the core library, see the links to the left. Sorry, we
		don't yet have a way to provide similar documentation for contributed
		libraries, but you can <a href="{% url jp_browser_libraries %}">browse libraries</a> and view
		their source to learn about the functionality they provide.</p>

		<p>If you are comfortable with a command line and prefer working locally, the
		Add-ons Builder SDK gives you a development environment on your own computer. 
		<a href="https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/sdk/latest/docs/">Read the SDK
		documentation</a> for help with it.</p>

		<p>If you have questions about Add-ons Builder that aren't addressed by this
		documentation, feel free to ask them in the <a
		href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla-labs-jetpack">project discussion
		group</a>. That's also the appropriate place to provide feedback about how the
		site works for you and what additional features you'd like it to provide.</p>
